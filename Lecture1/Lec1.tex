Some definions

\begin{mydef}
Information visualization: a mapping between discrete data and visual representation. communication of abstract data through the use of interactive visual interfaces. utilizes computer graphics and interaction to assist humans in solving problems.
\end{mydef}

Data visualization usually deals with quantitative data, information visualization tries to represent \textit{abstract} data. Information design starts with data that already has a clear structure. With information visualization, we first need to discover the structure, and a visualization is successful if it reveals the structure.
